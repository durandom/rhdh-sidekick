# Claude Command: Commit

This command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji.

## Usage

To create a commit, just type:
```
/commit
```

Or to analyze staged changes instead of session summary:
```
/commit --staged
```

## What This Command Does

1. Automatically runs pre-commit checks:
   - `make prepare-commit` which runs consistent pre-commit hooks for code quality, formatting, and type checking
2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`
3. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
4. Creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format based on:
   - **Default behavior**: Summarizes the current session's work and changes
   - **With `--staged` flag**: Performs a `git diff` to analyze staged changes and determine if multiple commits are needed

## Available Makefile Targets

The project now includes these helpful targets for development:

- **`make prepare-commit`**: Main commit preparation using pre-commit hooks
- **`make validate-tooling`**: Check if tools would make changes before committing
- **`make lint`**: Run ruff linting with fixes on src/ and tests/
- **`make format`**: Run ruff code formatting on src/ and tests/
- **`make typecheck`**: Run mypy type checking on src/ and tests/
- **`make test`**: Run pytest test suite
- **`make quality`**: Run all quality checks (lint + typecheck + test)

## Best Practices for Commits

- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose
- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits
- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ✨ `feat`: New feature
  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation
  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style
  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring

## Guidelines for Splitting Commits

When analyzing the diff, consider splitting commits based on these criteria:

1. **Different concerns**: Changes to unrelated parts of the codebase
2. **Different types of changes**: Mixing features, fixes, refactoring, etc.
3. **File patterns**: Changes to different types of files (e.g., source code vs documentation)
4. **Logical grouping**: Changes that would be easier to understand or review separately
5. **Size**: Very large changes that would be clearer if broken down

## Examples

Good commit messages:
- ✨ feat: add user authentication system
- 🐛 fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process
- 📝 docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
- ♻️ refactor: simplify error handling logic in parser
- 🚨 fix: resolve linter warnings in component files
- 🧑‍💻 chore: improve developer tooling setup process
- 👔 feat: implement business logic for transaction validation
- 🩹 fix: address minor styling inconsistency in header
- 🚑️ fix: patch critical security vulnerability in auth flow
- 🎨 style: reorganize component structure for better readability
- 🔥 fix: remove deprecated legacy code
- 🦺 feat: add input validation for user registration form
- 💚 fix: resolve failing CI pipeline tests
- 📈 feat: implement analytics tracking for user engagement
- 🔒️ fix: strengthen authentication password requirements
- ♿️ feat: improve form accessibility for screen readers

Example of splitting commits:
- First commit: ✨ feat: add new solc version type definitions
- Second commit: 📝 docs: update documentation for new solc versions
- Third commit: 🔧 chore: update package.json dependencies
- Fourth commit: 🏷️ feat: add type definitions for new API endpoints
- Fifth commit: 🧵 feat: improve concurrency handling in worker threads
- Sixth commit: 🚨 fix: resolve linting issues in new code
- Seventh commit: ✅ test: add unit tests for new solc version features
- Eighth commit: 🔒️ fix: update dependencies with security vulnerabilities

## Command Options

- `--staged`: Analyze staged changes with git diff instead of summarizing the current session

## Improved Tooling Workflow

The project now uses a streamlined approach to avoid back-and-forth fixing:

### Before Development
- **`make validate-tooling`**: Check if any tools would make changes
- **`make quality`**: Run all quality checks to catch issues early

### During Development
- **`make lint`**: Quick linting with auto-fixes
- **`make format`**: Code formatting
- **`make typecheck`**: Type checking

### Before Committing
- **`make prepare-commit`**: Comprehensive pre-commit validation
- All tools now use consistent configurations (no more conflicting fixes)

## Important Notes

- Pre-commit checks (`make prepare-commit`) will always run to ensure code quality
- **Consistent tooling**: All tools (Makefile, pre-commit, pyproject.toml) now use aligned configurations
- **Fail fast**: The process stops on first tool failure instead of continuing with inconsistent changes
- If these checks fail, you'll be asked if you want to proceed with the commit anyway or fix the issues first
- If specific files are already staged, the command will only commit those files
- If no files are staged, it will automatically stage all modified and new files
- The commit message will be constructed based on:
  - **Default**: Current session summary and context
  - **With `--staged`**: Git diff analysis of staged changes
- With `--staged` flag, the command will review the diff to identify if multiple commits would be more appropriate
- If suggesting multiple commits, it will help you stage and commit the changes separately

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter tooling issues:

1. **Run validation first**: `make validate-tooling`
2. **Check individual tools**: `make lint`, `make format`, `make typecheck`
3. **Fix issues incrementally**: Address one tool's output at a time
4. **Verify consistency**: Ensure all three config files are aligned
