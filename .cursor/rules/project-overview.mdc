# Project Overview

sidekick is a modern Python CLI application template built with best practices and production-ready features.

## Core Technologies
- **uv** for dependency management and virtual environments
- **Typer** for CLI framework with Rich for beautiful output
- **Pydantic** for data validation and settings management
- **Loguru** for structured logging
- **Ruff** for linting and formatting
- **pytest** for testing with coverage

## Project Structure
- `src/sidekick/` - Main application code
- `tests/` - Test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- `docs/` - Documentation and plans
- `logs/` - Application and test logs
- `Makefile` - Development workflow commands

## Template Purpose
This is a CLI application template designed to be easily customizable for new projects. When adapting for a new project:
1. Rename package: Update `pyproject.toml` and rename `src/sidekick` directory
2. Update imports: Change all `sidekick` imports to new package name
3. Customize commands: Modify `commands.py` or create new command modules
4. Add dependencies: Use `uv add package-name` for new dependencies
5. Update documentation: Modify README.md and CLAUDE.md for specific use case
