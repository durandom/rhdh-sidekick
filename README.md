# After initial generation, you can ask:
# - "Make it more concise"
# - "Add more technical details"
# - "Explain the security improvements"
# - "Format this for a blog post"
```

### How It Works

1. **Fetches JIRA ticket details** using the provided ticket ID
2. **Extracts GitHub PR links** from ticket descriptions, comments, or fields
3. **Retrieves PR details** including descriptions, changes, and commits
4. **Generates comprehensive release notes** using AI that includes:
   - Clear title based on JIRA ticket summary
   - Key changes and improvements from PR descriptions
   - Technical details from changed files when relevant
   - Proper markdown or text formatting

> **Note**: The release notes generator is based on work from [dzemanov/release-notes-generator](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/dzemanov/release-notes-generator) ([GitHub](https://github.com/dzemanov)).

## üîç Test Analysis

The test analysis feature provides AI-powered root cause analysis for Playwright test failures from Prow CI logs. It automatically analyzes test artifacts including JUnit XML files, screenshots, and pod logs to identify the cause of test failures.

### Usage

```bash
# Analyze a specific Prow CI test failure using the team approach (default)
uv run sidekick test-analysis analyze "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/pull/123/test-run-456"

# Use the single agent instead of the team for analysis
uv run sidekick test-analysis analyze --agent "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/pull/123/test-run-456"

# Download artifacts first, then analyze using cached data
uv run sidekick test-analysis download "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/pull/123/test-run-456"
uv run sidekick test-analysis analyze "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/pull/123/test-run-456"

# Show available commands and options
uv run sidekick test-analysis --help
```

### How It Works

1. **Extracts test artifacts** from Prow CI logs stored in Google Cloud Storage
2. **Parses JUnit XML files** to identify failed test cases and extract failure messages
3. **Analyzes screenshots** using AI vision to understand visual test failures
4. **Reviews pod logs** and build logs for additional context
5. **Provides comprehensive root cause analysis** with:
   - Clear explanation of what went wrong
   - Visual confirmation from screenshots when available
   - Specific failure points from logs
   - Actionable insights for fixing the issues

### Interactive Follow-up

After initial analysis, you can ask follow-up questions:

```bash
# After initial analysis, you can ask:
# - "Can you explain the screenshot in more detail?"
# - "What logs should I check for more information?"
# - "How can I reproduce this failure locally?"
# - "What are the most common causes of this type of failure?"
```

### Analysis Modes

The test analysis feature supports two analysis modes:

#### Team Mode (Default)
- **Coordinate Mode Team**: Uses specialized agents for different types of analysis
- **Screenshot Analyzer**: Dedicated agent for visual evidence analysis

## üìö Knowledge Management

The knowledge management system allows you to sync and manage documentation from multiple sources including Google Drive, Git repositories, and web pages. All content is automatically organized and made searchable through the AI-powered search functionality.

### Quick Start

1. **Edit configuration file**:
   ```bash
   # The default configuration is at knowledge/external/sources.yaml
   vi knowledge/external/sources.yaml
   ```

2. **Sync all sources**:
   ```bash
   # Sync all configured sources (uses knowledge/external/sources.yaml ‚Üí knowledge/external/ by default)
   uv run sidekick knowledge sync
   ```

3. **Search your knowledge**:
   ```bash
   # Search across all synced content using interactive chat
   uv run sidekick chat search "How to configure authentication"
   ```

### Configuration

Knowledge sources are defined in `knowledge/external/sources.yaml` by default. The system supports three source types:

#### Google Drive Documents
```yaml
- type: gdrive
  name: team-docs
  export_format: md
  documents:
    - url: "https://docs.google.com/document/d/DOCUMENT_ID/edit"
      depth: 2  # Follow links 2 levels deep
      comment: "Main documentation"
```

#### Git Repositories
```yaml
- type: git
  name: project-docs
  url: "https://github.com/org/repo"
  branch: main
  follow_links: true
  files:
    - "docs/**/*.md"
    - "README.md"
    - "*.md"
```

#### Web Pages
```yaml
- type: web
  name: external-docs
  urls:
    - "https://docs.example.com"
  depth: 2
  patterns:
    - "*/docs/*"
    - "*/documentation/*"
  export_format: md
```

### Commands

#### Sync Command
```bash
# Sync all sources from default configuration (knowledge/external/sources.yaml ‚Üí knowledge/external/)
uv run sidekick knowledge sync

# Sync specific source by name
uv run sidekick knowledge sync --source gdrive

# Use custom configuration file and output directory
uv run sidekick knowledge sync --config my-sources.yaml --base-path knowledge/my-project
```

#### Download Commands
Download specific content without editing the configuration file:

```bash
# Download Google Drive documents
uv run sidekick knowledge download gdrive "https://docs.google.com/document/d/ID/edit" --depth 2

# Download from Git repository
uv run sidekick knowledge download git "https://github.com/org/repo" --branch main --files "docs/**/*.md"

# Download web pages
uv run sidekick knowledge download web "https://example.com/docs" --depth 2
```

#### Reindex Command
Rebuild the vector database for improved search performance:

```bash
# Reindex knowledge base with default paths
uv run sidekick knowledge reindex

# Reindex with custom knowledge directory
uv run sidekick knowledge reindex --knowledge-path ./docs

# Reindex with custom vector database path and table name
uv run sidekick knowledge reindex --vector-db-path ./vectordb --table-name my_docs
```

The reindex command is useful when:
- Documents have been updated or modified outside of the sync process
- Search results seem outdated or incomplete
- The vector database has become corrupted
- You want to rebuild embeddings with updated AI models

### Directory Structure

The knowledge system organizes content by source:
```

## üé® Prompt Management

The prompt management system provides tools for managing, viewing, and creating prompt templates used by various agents and features throughout sidekick.

### Usage

```bash
# List all available prompt templates
uv run sidekick prompts list

# Refresh template cache and list
uv run sidekick prompts list --refresh

# Show details of a specific template
uv run sidekick prompts show agents.search

# Show formatted output with default variables
uv run sidekick prompts show agents.search --format

# Show raw template content
uv run sidekick prompts show agents.search --raw

# Validate all prompt templates
uv run sidekick prompts validate

# Validate specific template file or directory
uv run sidekick prompts validate path/to/templates

# Create a new prompt template
uv run sidekick prompts create my_agent
```

### Template Structure

Prompt templates are YAML files that define reusable instructions for AI agents:

```yaml
name: example_agent
version: "1.0"
description: "Description of what this agent does"

# Variables that can be customized
variables:
  example_var: "default_value"

# Include shared instructions
includes:
  - shared/common_instructions.yaml

# Main template content
template: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant.

  Your variable: {{example_var}}

  CAPABILITIES:
  - List what this agent can do

  GUIDELINES:
  - Add specific guidelines
```

### Features

- **Template Discovery**: Automatically discovers and loads templates from the templates directory
- **Variable Substitution**: Support for template variables with default values
- **Template Includes**: Reuse common instructions across multiple templates
- **Validation**: Validate template syntax and structure
- **Multiple Formats**: View templates as raw YAML, formatted markdown, or instruction lists
- **Template Creation**: Starter template generator for new agents

### Template Organization

Templates are organized by category:

```
src/sidekick/prompts/templates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # Agent-specific prompts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jira.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ github.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # Shared instructions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common_instructions.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ teams/           # Team coordination prompts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tag_team.yaml
```

### Using Templates in Code

Agents can use templates programmatically:

```python
from sidekick.prompts import get_agent_instructions_from_template

# Load and format a template
instructions = get_agent_instructions_from_template(
    "agents.search",
    variables={"custom_var": "value"}
)
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Jira Triager

This tool uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow: it leverages a local knowledge base of historical Jira issues and a LLM to recommend the best team and component for new Jira tickets. The agent performs semantic search over past issues to provide context-aware, data-driven triage recommendations.

### 1. Extract Jira Data for RAG-Powered Triage

Before you can triage Jira issues, you must first build the local knowledge base by extracting historical Jira issues. This is done with the `load-jira-knowledge` command:

**Usage:**

```
uv run sidekick jira-triager load-jira-knowledge [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--projects TEXT`  Comma-separated list of Jira project keys (default: `RHDHSUPP,RHIDP,RHDHBUGS`)
- `--jql-extra TEXT` Extra JQL filter to further restrict issues (e.g., `AND status = "Closed"`)
- `--num-issues INTEGER` Number of issues to return per project (default: 50)

**Behavior:**
- Always applies built-in filters: only issues with `resolution = "Done"`, `resolutiondate >= -360d`, `Team` and `component` present.
- Combines issues from all specified projects into a single file: `tmp/jira_knowledge_base.json`

> **Note:** You must run this command at least once before using the triage command. Re-run it whenever you want to refresh the knowledge base with new Jira data.

---

### 2. Triage Jira Issues Using the RAG Agent

Once the knowledge base is built, you can triage Jira issues using the following command. The agent will use semantic search and LLM reasoning to recommend assignments:

```bash
# Triage a Jira issue by ticket ID (fields auto-fetched)
uv run sidekick jira-triager triage RHIDP-6496

# Triage a Jira issue by manually specifying fields
uv run sidekick jira-triager triage --title "Password reset fails" --description "Reset link returns 500 error."

# Override specific fields when using a ticket ID
uv run sidekick jira-triager triage RHIDP-6496 --component "Authentication" --team ""
```

- The command will recommend the best team and component for the given Jira issue.
- If you provide a Jira issue ID, the tool will automatically fetch the title, description, components, team, and assignee from Jira.

#### How It Works

1. **Fetches Jira issue details** using the provided ticket ID.
2. **Retrieves historical Jira tickets** from the local knowledge base for context using semantic search.
3. **Uses a large language model (LLM) with RAG** to analyze the current issue in the context of past tickets, considering any existing assignments.
4. **Recommends the most appropriate team and component** for the issue, filling in only missing fields and respecting any already-assigned values.
5. **Outputs the recommended assignment** directly in the CLI.

---

### Future Improvements
- Better Jira integration:
  - Pull Jira issues with missing team/components automatically
  - Implement command to apply changes to the Jira ticket automatically
- Consider assigning multiple related components
- Consider: For ArgoCD (not Roadie), Tekton and Quay plugins RHDHBugs should go to RHTAPBugs and engage the RHTAP UI team.
