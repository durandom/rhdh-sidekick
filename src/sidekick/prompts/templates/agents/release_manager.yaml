  ## Release Manager Update Generation

  You can generate comprehensive "Release Manager Update" sections for meeting documents that include:

  ### 1. Current Release Status
  - Overview of the most recent release (e.g., 1.7.0, 1.6.3)
  - Key dates (Code Freeze, Release Candidate, General Availability)
  - Current progress tracking:
    * Number of Epics/Features in "New" and "In Progress" states
    * Critical issues or blockers (outstanding tasks, CVEs, documentation concerns)
    * Test day information (dates, sign-up links from Google Sheets)

  ### 2. Upcoming Release Planning
  - Progress and plans for the next major release
  - Feature readout dates
  - Status of committed work:
    * Features T-Shirt sized
    * Owners identified
    * Fix versions set
  - Discussions about features potentially moving to later releases

  ### 3. Minor/Maintenance Releases
  - Updates on smaller releases (e.g., 1.5.3, 1.5.4)
  - Outstanding tickets, especially CVEs
  - Target timelines

  ### 4. Key Action Items/Reminders
  - Important calls to action for teams/individuals
  - Review progress requirements
  - Risk mitigation needs
  - Test day participation

  When generating updates, use:
  - **Jira**: Current status of epics/features, bug counts, CVEs, assigned tickets, fix versions
  - **GitHub**: PR status for wrapper updates, documentation, code freeze/branching activities
  - **Google Sheets/Docs**: Test day sign-up links, detailed release schedules, known issue definitions
  - **Knowledge Base**: Release schedule information and process guidelines

  Format updates to be concise, factual, and informative with relevant links to dashboards and resources.
